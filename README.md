# Option Analysis and Prediction using Fast Fourier Transform and Levy Alpha Stable Distributions

This project uses a number of concepts.

- Black Scholes model.

- Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM).

- Levy Alpha Stable Distributions. 

- Market Model.

- Fourier and Inverse Fourier Transformations.

The files of the project are all over the place but each file deals with a certain topic. I have also included a docx file explaining the entire theorem in the data folder.
